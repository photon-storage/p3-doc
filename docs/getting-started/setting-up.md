# Setting Up

The only thing you need to access P3 service is a pair of access key ID and access key secret, which are used to authenticate incoming requests by P3 gateways.

We suggest you save the access key ID and secret into environment variables `P3_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `P3_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET` as our SDK can read them directly. This could save your effort to pass them in as flags repeatedly.

If you want to get accesses to P3, please contact Photon team.
