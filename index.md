## Decentralization

P3 is powered by Photon decentralized storage protocol. With the characteristics inherited from the underlying blockchain technology, P3 is decentralzied by nature. It offers strong guarantee for availability, privacy, and censorship resistenance. Those properties make it a nice fit for Web3 applications as their storage infrustructure.

## High performance

P3 is architectured as a high-performance object storage engine. You never need to sacrifice performance and scalability for decentralization as which is the general impression for Web3 applications. P3's RESTful API can commit and retrieve any amount of data, with performance on par with Amazon S3. As a result, it is capable of serving internet scale applications.

## Cost effectiveness

Storage fee and bandwidth usage charge are two major costs for storage service. When application data are retrieved repeatedly, bandwidth cost can become a dominant factor. P3's decentralized protocol aggregates abundant inexpensive bandwidth, making it favorable when comparing cost with centralized storage service.
